I have created two files :
Business Logic Written in : ContentRead.cs - This is actually reading the content from the destination folder.
Driver Class : Program.cs - It is making call to above class to fetch the things.

Input Parameters you need to provide on the fly while project running.

I have not included the static files along this project.
But they will work, I have tested locally.
